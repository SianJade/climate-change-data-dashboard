                            <li>When sea levels rise as rapidly as they have been, even a small increase can have devastating effects on coastal habitats farther inland, it can cause destructive erosion, wetland flooding, aquifer and agricultural soil contamination
                                with salt, and lost habitat for fish, birds, and plants.
                            </li>
                            <li>Higher sea levels are coinciding with more dangerous hurricanes and typhoons that move more slowly and drop more rain, contributing to more powerful storm surges that can strip away everything in their path. One study found
                                that between 1963 and 2012, almost half of all deaths from Atlantic hurricanes were caused by storm surges.

                            <li>Already, flooding in low-lying coastal areas is forcing people to migrate to higher ground, and millions more are vulnerable from flood risk and other climate change effects. The prospect of higher coastal water levels threatens
                                basic services such as Internet access, since much of the underlying communications infrastructure lies in the path of rising seas.

                        <ul>
                            <li>More frequent and severe weather; higher temperatures are worsening many types of disasters, including storms, heat waves, floods, and droughts. A warmer climate creates an atmosphere that can collect, retain, and drop more
                                water, changing weather patterns in such a way that wet areas become wetter and dry areas drier.
                            </li>
                            <li>Rising temperatures also worsen air pollution by increasing ground level ozone, which is created when pollution from cars, factories, and other sources react to sunlight and heat. Ground-level ozone is the main component of
                                smog, and the hotter things get, the more of it we have. Dirtier air is linked to higher hospital admission rates and higher death rates for asthmatics. It worsens the health of people suffering from cardiac or pulmonary
                                disease. And warmer temperatures also significantly increase airborne pollen, which is bad news for those who suffer from hay fever and other allergies.
                            </li>
                            <li>Rising temperatures also mean higher sea levels - the polar regions are particularly vulnerable to a warming atmosphere. Average temperatures in the Arctic are rising twice as fast as they are elsewhere on earth, and the world's
                                ice sheets are melting fast. This not only has grave consequences for the region's people, wildlife, and plants; its most serious impact may be on rising sea levels.

                            <li>Carbon dioxide emissions impact human health by displacing oxygen in the atmosphere. Breathing becomes more difficult as carbon dioxide levels rise. In closed areas, high levels of carbon dioxide can lead to health complaints
                                such as headaches. Carbon dioxide levels may indicate high levels of other harmful air pollutants such as volatile organic compounds which contribute to indoor air pollution.

                            <li>The oceans absorb almost a quarter of CO2 emitted in the atmosphere. The excess CO2 reacts with the seawater to form carbonic acid. The acidification causes suppression of carbonate ion concentration that is essential for animals
                                in the sea such as corals and shellfish to build bones and shells.

                            <li>Carbon dioxide contributes to air pollution in its role in the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide traps radiation at ground level, creating ground-level ozone. This atmospheric layer prevents the earth from cooling at night.
                                One result is a warming of ocean waters. Oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, higher water temperatures compromise the oceans' ability to absorb carbon dioxide. Over time, the effects of carbon dioxide
                                are compounded.
                            </li>
                            <li>Another environmental effect of carbon dioxide on air pollution is climate change. The earth's surface temperature has risen over the last 100 years, according to studies done by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
                                (NOAA). Scientists believe carbon dioxide pollution is the primary culprit. The effects are highly complex. Evidence shows, however, that ocean water levels have increased, resulting in a loss of shoreline and coastal wetlands.
                            </li>
                            <li>Carbon dioxide is a contributor to the environmental effect known as acid rain. Emissions released from fossil fuel-burning energy plants combine with moisture in the air. The result is precipitation with a high acid content.
                                Documented evidence shows the physical damage to trees and other plant life. Water and soil pollution occur from the acidic precipitation. A complicating factor is the mobility of emissions. The effects of carbon dioxide
                                can be seen and felt far from their sources, making their impacts on air pollution more serious.

                            <li>Plants help to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air and significantly decreases the presence of toxic gases like methane. Forest are natural effective carbon sink. Carbon given out from burning fossil fuels is absorbed
                                by the forests.

                                pollution but help to preserve wildlife.

                            <li>Most renewable energy sources produce little to no global warming emissions. Even when including “life cycle” emissions of clean energy (ie, the emissions from each stage of a technology’s life—manufacturing, installation,
                                operation, decommissioning), the global warming emissions associated with renewable energy are minimal.
                            </li>
                            <li> Wind, solar, and hydroelectric systems generate electricity with no associated air pollution emissions. Geothermal and biomass systems emit some air pollutants, though total air emissions are generally much lower than those
                                of coal- and natural gas-fired power plants.
                            </li>
                            <li>Wind and solar energy require essentially no water to operate and thus do not pollute water resources or strain supplies by competing with agriculture, drinking water, or other important water needs. In contrast, fossil fuels
                                can have a significant impact on water resources: both coal mining and natural gas drilling can pollute sources of drinking water, and all thermal power plants, including those powered by coal, gas, and oil, withdraw and
                                consume water for cooling.

                            <li>Compared with fossil fuel technologies, which are typically mechanized and capital intensive, the renewable energy industry is more labor intensive. Solar panels need humans to install them; wind farms need technicians for
                                maintenance.
                            </li>
                            <li>In addition to the jobs directly created in the renewable energy industry, growth in clean energy can create positive economic “ripple” effects. For example, industries in the renewable energy supply chain will benefit, and
                                unrelated local businesses will benefit from increased household and business incomes.
                            </li>
                            <li>Local governments also benefit from clean energy, most often in the form of property and income taxes and other payments from renewable energy project owners. Owners of the land on which wind projects are built often receive
                                lease payments ranging from $3,000 to $6,000 per megawatt of installed capacity, as well as payments for power line easements and road rights-of-way. They may also earn royalties based on the project’s annual revenues.
                                Farmers and rural landowners can generate new sources of supplemental income by producing feedstocks for biomass power facilities.

                        <ul>
                            <li> There are four actions that could result in substantial decreases in an individual's carbon footprint: eating a plant-based diet, avoiding air travel, living car free, and having smaller families. For example, living car-free
                                saves about 2.4 tonnes of C02 equivalent per year, while eating a plant-based diet saves 0.8 tonnes of C02 equivalent a year.
                            </li>
                            <li>A family who chooses to have one fewer child would provide the same level of emissions reductions as 684 teenagers who choose to adopt comprehensive recycling for the rest of their lives.
                            </li>
                            <li>Researchers found that avoiding one trans-Atlantic flight per year can save between 0.7 and 2.8 tonnes of C02 equivalent per year (depending on the distance travelled, amount of luggage on board and how many passengers on the flight).
                            </li>
