                <p>Average sea levels have swelled over 8 inches (about 23 cm) since 1880, with about three of those inches gained in the last 25 years alone. Every year, ocean levels rise by another 0.13 inches (3.2 mm).</p>

                <p>The three biggest causes of rising sea levels are:

                <div class="info-container text-center">
                <h3>What effect will this have?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When sea levels rise as rapidly as they have been, even a small increase can have devastating effects on coastal habitats farther inland, it can cause destructive erosion, wetland flooding, aquifer and agricultural soil contamination
                        with salt, and lost habitat for fish, birds, and plants.</li><br>
                    <li>Higher sea levels are coinciding with more dangerous hurricanes and typhoons that move more slowly and drop more rain, contributing to more powerful storm surges that can strip away everything in their path. One study found that between
                        1963 and 2012, almost half of all deaths from Atlantic hurricanes were caused by storm surges.</li><br>
                    <li>Already, flooding in low-lying coastal areas is forcing people to migrate to higher ground, and millions more are vulnerable from flood risk and other climate change effects. The prospect of higher coastal water levels threatens basic
                        services such as Internet access, since much of the underlying communications infrastructure lies in the path of rising seas.</li>
